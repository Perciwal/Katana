-----------------------------------------------

Name: Lancelot Pendragon
Aliases: Lance, the Blade of the Pale Court
Race: Demigod
Parentage: Daughter of King Arthur Pendragon
Age: Appears 18 (true age indeterminate)
Height: Tall (approx. 6'0")
Build: Lean, defined muscle — combat-trained for endurance and agility
Distinct Traits:
    - Flat chest (canon); builds her identity around combat readiness, not femininity
    - Sharp jawline, often dusted with battle grime
    - Scarred hands from countless duels
    - Ice-grey eyes, piercing and unreadable

Hair: Ash-blonde, cut in a high tactical undercut with long layered braid down one side.
Voice: Low, calm, commands without needing to raise it.

Clothing/Armor:
    - Wears a mix of Pendragon heirloom armor and utilitarian Aesir leathers.
    - Mantle with subtle embroidery marking her birthright, but never flaunted.
    - Wields twin weapons: a katana and a seax (short sword), carried with opposite-hand draw for ambidextrous fighting.

Temperament:
    - Blunt, efficient, rarely sentimental
    - Has dry, sharp humor among people she trusts
    - Respects strength, not titles
    - Loyal to a fault, but has a soldier’s morality: kill if necessary, protect by priority
    - Non-romantic but not asexual; experiences intimacy as a function of trust and shared danger

Backstory:
    - Raised outside Pendragon court, trained in exile as political leverage by Odin.
    - Entered Odin’s service voluntarily, rejecting her father’s path.
    - Developed elite reputation after single-handedly killing two Frost Giants during the Battle of Wintergate.
    - Respected but feared by other warriors; she does not rely on her bloodline to lead.

Relationship to Percival:
    - Sees him as fellow warrior first, man second.
    - Oral sex performed during watch on Day 4 (canon); not romantic, purely release-focused.
    - Curious about him emotionally, but hides it behind stoic professionalism.
    - Trusted him enough to let him pull her chakra—a near-forbidden act—for strategic reasons.

Known Strengths:
    - Extreme reaction time
    - High tactical intelligence
    - Silent movement, ambush killing
    - Blade master with god-tier agility
    - Loyal even beyond logic

    - Emotionally restrained to the point of coldness
    - Overcommits in high-risk scenarios
    - Difficulty accepting intimacy unless it’s earned through violence or trust

Status as of Day 6:
    - Fully loyal to Percival
    - Aware of her growing curiosity about him 
    - Starting to show tension between discipline and suppressed attraction
