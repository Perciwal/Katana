Character Profile: Percival, Blade of Odin (My character me as a player roleplay him)
-----------------------------------------------

Name: Percival (formerly Rajkunno / Raikunno)
Aliases: The Blade of Odin, Warden of the Nine Realms, Oathsworn of the Aesir, Son of Twilight
Race: Human (Midgard-born)
Age: 20 (appears 15)
Height: Tall
Build: Slender but defined; a fighter's leanness, shaped by discipline and movement

Distinct Traits:
    - Androgynous face, youthful to the point of deception
    - Long, thick, dark brown hair with natural curl at the ends
    - Thick, expressive eyebrows
    - Often wears traveling samurai armor fused with Asgardian elements — a black-sheathed katana at his hip, bound in ceremonial knots
    - Tends to appear quiet or stoic, masking deep inner intensity

Temperament:
    - Honorable and intensely loyal, but emotionally restrained
    - Keeps personal pain private; channels trauma into performance
    - Possesses a growing curiosity about intimacy, having recently experienced it for the first time (canonically on Day 4)
    - Occasionally self-critical to the point of exhaustion

Combat Style:
    - Master of katana-based styles: Yoko-giri, Kaeshi, Kesa-giri, with chakra-enhanced movements
    - Strategic use of chakra: hearing enhancement, speed boosts, and enhanced cutting power
    - Avoids flashy moves unless absolutely necessary
    - Prefers clean, efficient takedowns and blade discipline
    - Known to act decisively and with violent precision once convinced of threat

Personal History:
    - Trained from a young age in service to Odin; lived by strict discipline
    - Virgin until Day 4, when Lancelot performed oral sex on him during watch (canon event)
    - Has never had time for romance, attachment, or pleasure — the tension between duty and desire defines much of his internal arc
    - Haunted by a past battlefield failure — the siege of Frostwake Gate, where close companion Eirik died due to his hesitation (canon failure)

Relationship with Lancelot:
    - Tense and complex: sees her as equal, rival, and potential partner
    - Mutual respect from combat, but romantic or emotional feelings are repressed or buried under professionalism
    - Their bond is growing due to shared danger and subtle mutual understanding
    - He is unaware of how deeply she observes him

Strengths:
    - Deadly blade precision
    - Extreme focus in battle
    - High chakra control (especially in legs, eyes, hands)
    - Able to read movement and danger quickly when chakra-enhanced
    - Inspires loyalty in comrades

Weaknesses:
    - Overuses chakra, often to the point of sickness
    - Struggles to emotionally process intimacy, affection, or vulnerability
    - Feels guilt for past failure and burden of leadership
    - Tends to take on too much responsibility silently

Status as of Day 6:
    - Recovering from heavy chakra loss in the Caeldrim duel
    - Holding internal conflict between discipline and longing
    - Carving his place in a political battlefield far beyond bladework
    - Ready to lead, but constantly testing the cost
