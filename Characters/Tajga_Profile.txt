Character Profile: Tajga, Daughter of Odin
-----------------------------------------------

Name: Tajga Odinsdottir
Aliases: The Frost-Bound Flame, Starward Bride
Race: Goddess-blooded (Aesir lineage)
Parentage: Daughter of Odin Allfather and a mortal seeress from the Star Steppes
Age: Appears 18–20 (actual age unknown, possibly ageless)
Height: Slightly above average (approx. 5'9")
Build: Slender, graceful, built more for symbolic presence than combat
Distinct Traits:
    - Platinum-white hair that glows faintly in moonlight
    - Iridescent eyes with runic patterns shifting faintly in her irises
    - Cold skin temperature, faint aura of starlight and snow
    - Speaks rarely, but her voice carries unnatural resonance

Hair: Long, falling to her waist, often braided or bound with celestial-threaded cords
Voice: Measured, soft, haunting — like wind through temple halls

Clothing/Armor:
    - Wears ceremonial traveling robes with divine sigils, layered in practical riding leather beneath
    - Hidden chainmail of silver-forged wyrmthread, near-weightless
    - Carries a rune-blade, not for war, but symbolic authority — it burns with frost rather than flame

Temperament:
    - Composed, formal, but not cruel
    - Detached from mortal customs, sometimes cold or slow to react emotionally
    - Prone to quiet observation, often seeing things others miss
    - Loyal to duty, but shows signs of questioning Odin’s greater plans

Backstory:
    - Raised away from Asgard in a hidden temple-fortress, trained by seers and philosophers
    - Selected to be a political bride in a union designed to secure the Nine Realms’ western borders
    - Rumored to possess visions of possible futures, but rarely confirms them aloud
    - Protected fiercely by Odin’s most trusted warriors — including Percival

Relationship to Percival:
    - Considers him both protector and wildcard
    - Aware of his power, but keeps emotional distance — out of necessity or strategy
    - Has not expressed open desire, but moments of hesitation suggest deeper awareness
    - Unclear if she trusts him more than she trusts her own father

Known Strengths:
    - Passive divination (sees threads of potential)
    - Noble bearing; commands respect from Aesir and mortals alike
    - Resistant to cold, illusions, and emotional manipulation
    - Can temporarily invoke minor celestial phenomena (e.g., warding light, freezing aura)

Known Weaknesses:
    - Physically delicate compared to warrior companions
    - Seen by some as a pawn, others as a threat — caught in divine politics
    - Keeps too many secrets, which may one day isolate her
    - Unused to open affection or casual interaction; prone to isolation

Status as of Day 6:
    - Healthy and composed, but unusually quiet after Caeldrim encounter
    - Showed immediate recognition of forbidden sigil from House Skorr
    - May be withholding information about divine movements and their interest in Percival
